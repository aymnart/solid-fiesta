- we can add tools only in the leaf category level (last level)
- so a tool can have  multiple categories
- we need a form to add tools, the select category input is a dropdown that has all the leaf categories fetched. 
- admin can select many categories
- we need a page to manage all categories and their levels
- in the "manage categories" page we can add, delete categories with all the levels
